# The Motley Crew | Burning Man Bike

## Summary
This repo contains the code for my Burning Man bike project.

### Concept
Follow my progress on this project on [my website](https://austenclement.com/building-my-playa-bike-part-1/).

My goal is to turn this bike into a fluffy creature with gigantic googly eyes on it — like a Muppet. I was inspired by this quote from The Big Lez Show on YouTube:

[![Link to YouTube video "its got facken googly eyes on it"](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zrVhUX2bSWI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrVhUX2bSWI&t=17s)

> It’s got facken googly eyes on it mate

### Status
**2022 Aug 09** - So far I have only the basic code for the eyes of my bike. That can be found in the [eyes.ino](eyes.ino) file, which as of today is an exact copy of the [eyes_testing](https://github.com/austeninc/eyes_testing) repo (private).

### Project Files
**eyes.ino** - This file contains the code for running the LEDs in the eyes of my bike.

## Resources
Huge thanks to @jasoncoon for his LED mapper tool, which was instrumental in making this possible.
