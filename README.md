# The Motley Crew | Burning Man Bike

## Summary
This repo contains the code for my Burning Man bike project.

### Concept
Follow my progress on this project on [my website](https://austenclement.com/building-my-playa-bike-part-1/).

My goal is to turn this bike into a fluffy creature with gigantic googly eyes on it — like a Muppet. I was inspired by this quote from The Big Lez Show on YouTube:

[![Link to YouTube video "its got facken googly eyes on it"](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zrVhUX2bSWI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrVhUX2bSWI&t=17s)

> It’s got facken googly eyes on it mate

### Project Files
**eyes.ino** - This file contains the code for running the LEDs in the eyes of my bike.

## Resources
