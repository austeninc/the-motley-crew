# The Motley Crew | Burning Man Bike

## Summary
This repo contains the code for my Burning Man bike project.

### Concept
Follow my progress on this project on (my website)[https://austenclement.com/building-my-playa-bike-part-1/]

My goal is to turn this bike into a fluffy creature with gigantic googly eyes on it â€” like a Muppet. I was inspired by this quote from The Big Lez Show on YouTube:

### Project Files
**eyes.ino** - This file contains the code for running the LEDs in the eyes of my bike.

## Resources
Huge thanks to @jasoncoon for his LED mapper tool, which was instrumental in making this possible.
